                <p>Hardcore is a variant of Survival and one of the main game modes in Minecraft. In this mode, the world is locked to Hard difficulty and the player cannot respawn after dying.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The key feature of Hardcore mode is that the player is not given the option to respawn upon death as they would in other game modes. Instead, there are two buttons on the death screen: "Spectate world" and "Title screen". "Spectate world" sets the player to Spectator mode and respawns the player at the world's spawn point, making them able to view and explore the world only in that mode. The "Title screen" button simply leads the player to the main menu screen; re-opening the world simply returns the player back to the same death screen as before. Respawn anchors do not resurrect players in Hardcore mode.</p>
                <p>Hardcore mode is specific to worlds, not players; the variable determining whether the world is in Hardcore mode is saved in level.dat. Thus, the player can use /gamemode creative (if cheats are enabled) to set themselves to Creative mode. Players in Creative mode while on a Hardcore mode world still see Hardcore mode's death screen upon death.</p>
                <p>It is normally impossible to toggle Hardcore mode once the world has been created, though it is possible to use external programs such as NBTExplorer to change it by setting the hardcore tag to either 1 (hardcore) or 0 (normal).</p>
                <p>However, it is possible to enable cheats through the Open to LAN feature in the pause menu. From here, the player can, while spectating the world after death, type /gamemode survival to bring themselves back to Survival mode, being able to play again by cheating death.</p>

                <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Hardcore mode is an option for multiplayer, and its functions are similar to those in singleplayer. All players have Hardcore mode enabled â€” it is impossible to have some players in Hardcore and some not. Hardcore mode cannot be played in Realms.</p>
                <p>Server operators can use the /gamemode command to change the game mode of themselves or another player.</p>
